<h2>THE STUDIO SEEKER'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> On what occasions do you particularly seek the studios?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> On two Sundays in the year&mdash;the consecutive sabbaths
devoted to the exhibition of proposed academy pictures by "Outsiders,"
and "A.'s," and "R.A.'s."</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Do you haunt the abodes of artists at other times?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Never; or, to cover all possibilities, hardly ever.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then you are not a lover of paintings for their own sake?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly not; on the contrary, I am, as a rule, a better judge
of frames than canvases.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then why do you go to St. John's Wood, Chelsea and West
Kensington?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To see and be seen.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is it necessary to know the artist whose pictures are "on
view"?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly not. You can usually single him out by the absence
of an overcoat, and can generally spot his wife and daughter by the
non-appearance of promenading head-gear.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What have you to do when you have discovered your involuntary
host and hostess?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To shake hands with them with condescension, and partake of
their refreshments with gusto.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Will this invasion of the domestic circle be resented?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; because it is highly probable that you will be mistaken
for a newspaper Art critic, and respect for the Press in Art circles is
universal.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Are not artists, as a body, a community of highly accomplished
gentlemen?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly; and, consequently, on ordinary occasions entitled to
well-merited respect.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then why should that "well-merited respect" be refused to
them a month before the May opening of Burlington House?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because it is the fashion.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Surely this fashion does not exist amongst the better classes of
the community?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To some extent; although it certainly is in greatest favour
with cads and snobs, to say nothing of their female relations.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Has any effort been made to stem this tide of unauthorised
and unwelcome invasion?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> In isolated cases the master of the studio has sought the
protection of the police to keep his studio free of the unknown and
the unknowable.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But could not the scandal be removed with the assistance of
the leaders of Society?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Assuredly. It would only have to become unfashionable to
visit studios on the Show Sundays for the painter to be left at peace.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Would that be pleasing to the artists?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That is the published opinion, but the matter has not been put
absolutely to the test. However, the pleasure of the artists is not to be
considered when the recreations of Brixton and Tooting are at stake.</p>

<h2>APRIL FOOLOSOPHY.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>By One of Them.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.</i> Well, this only shows
our valiant disregard of danger, our readiness of initiative, our championship
of forlorn hopes. We are the heaven-sent leaders of all
"New" enterprises, whether literary, theatrical, or artistic. It is
we who penetrate the mysteries of Bodleyosophy, Beardsleyotechny,
and Yellow Astrology. We are the real and only Mahatmaniacs,
Sexomaniacs, Miasmaniacs. Among our ranks you will find the
Women who Did, the anticonjuGallias, the shedonKeynotes, and all
their attendant and Discordant tribe of Jack-asses. We are the
elect and proper bell-wethers of mankind. Come to us, then, for
guidance.</p>

<p><i>Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise.</i> Folly is therefore
the true wisdom. However, this is an Oscarian paradox, which
the Divine <span class="sc">Williams</span> has previously plagiarised, and enlarged on at
some length, so we will pass on.</p>

<p><i>Fools build houses, but wise men live in them.</i> Exactly so; we are
the architects of this generation. The wise man depends on us for
his roof and lodging; and without us he would be homeless. We
have built "Snookson's Folly" and "Babel Mansions"&mdash;half of
London, in fact. The jerry-builders have done the rest.</p>

<p><i>A fool and his money are soon parted.</i> A compliment to our open-handed
and indiscriminate generosity. It is we who swell the subscription
list for the last new gold mine or building society; who
subsidise insolvent South American Republics; who support the
mendicant tramp and the deserving blackmailer.</p>

<p><i>There is no fool like an old fool.</i> That is, the quality of folly improves
with keeping, like that of wine. The seniors of our class are
thoroughly reliable old fools, and Past Grand Masters in the art of
ineptitude. We, fools as we are, know how to pay the proper
respect that is due to senility and second-childishness.</p>

<p><i>A fool at forty is a fool indeed.</i> This is a corollary of the preceding
aphorism, for it is only at the age of two-score that we attain to
years of full indiscretion. We develop later than the rest of
humanity; we undergo a severe probation before our claim to the
title of complete nincompoop is recognised. Before forty there is yet
a chance that the budding ninny may desert, and degenerate into a
prig, a Philistine, or a physician. After that age he is safe, and can
be depended on for unwisdom, whereas your ordinary wiseacre cuts
his back teeth and graduates in common-sense at twenty-one.</p>

<p>Lastly, <i>Fools stand in slippery places</i>&mdash;where wise men tumble
down; but this needs no further illustration than that provided years
ago by C. K., in <i>Mr. Punch's</i> pages.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p class="ind1"><span class="sc">Not for their "Ben."</span>&mdash;Judging from some of the evidence at
the recent trial of <i>Tillett</i> v. "<i>The Morning</i>" (<i>Limited</i>), it
probably
occurred to the unemployed dockers that they might have been well
employed in "docking" B. T.'s salary.</p>

["In the presence of this band I now come to
hand my gift to your Serene Highness. I could
find no better present than a sword, the noblest
weapon of the Germans, a symbol of that weapon
which your Highness, with my blessed grandfather,
helped to forge, to sharpen, and also to
wield&mdash;a symbol of that great building-time
during which the mortar was blood and iron, a
remedy which never fails."&mdash;<i>The German Emperor,
in presenting a Sword of Honour to Prince
Bismarck, in celebration of his eightieth birthday.</i>]</p>

<p>["The notice which you have been pleased to
take of my labours, had it been early, had been
kind; but it has been delayed till I am indifferent,
and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary, and cannot
impart it; till I am known, and do not want it."&mdash;<i>Doctor
Johnson to the Earl of Chesterfield.</i>]

<h2 class="sans">DOING A CATHEDRAL.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>A Sketch from the Provinces.</i>)</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The interior of Dulchester Cathedral.</i> <span class="sc">Time</span>&mdash;<i>About 12.30.</i>
<i>The March sunshine slants in pale shafts through the clerestory
windows, leaving the aisles in shadow. From without, the
cawing of rooks and shouts of children at play are faintly
audible. By the West Door, a party of Intending Sightseers
have collected, and the several groups, feeling that it would be a
waste of time to observe anything in the building until officially
instructed to do so, are engaged in eyeing one another with all
the genial antipathy and suspicion of true-born Britons.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>A Stodgy Sightseer</i> (<i>to his friend</i>). Disgraceful, keeping us
standing
about like this! If I'd only known, I'd have told the headwaiter
at the "Mitre" to keep
back those chops till&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="foo">
<p>[<i>He breaks off abruptly, finding that the chops are
reverberating from column to column with disproportionate
solemnity; a white-haired and apple-faced
verger rustles down from the choir and beckons the
party forward benignantly, whereupon they advance
with a secret satisfaction at the prospect of
"getting the cathedral 'done' and having the rest
of the day to themselves;" they are conducted to a
desk and requested, as a preliminary, to put sixpence
apiece in the Restoration Fund box and inscribe
their names in a book.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Confused Murmurs.</i> Would
you put "Portico Lodge, Camden
Road, or only London?"...
Here, I'd better sign for
the lot of you, eh?... They
<i>might</i> provide a better pen&mdash;in
a <i>cathedral</i>, I <i>do</i> think!...
He might have given all our
names in full instead of just
"And party"!... Oh, I've
been and made a blot&mdash;will it
<i>matter</i>, should you think?...
I never <i>can</i> write my name
with people looking on, can
<i>you?</i>... I'm sure you've
done it beautifully, dear!...
Just hold my umbrella while I
take off my glove, <span class="sc">Maria</span>....
Oh, why <i>don't</i> they make
haste? &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>The</i> Stodgy Sightseer<i> fumes, feeling that, while
they are fiddling, his chops are burning</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Verger.</i> Now, ladies
and gentlemen, if you will please to follow me, the portion of the
building where we now are is part of the original hedifice founded
by <span class="sc">Ealfrytha</span>, wife of Earl <span class="sc">Baldric</span>, in the year height 'undred
heighty-height, though we 'ave reason to believe that an even hearlier
church was in existence 'ere so far back as the Roman occupation, as
is proved by a hancient stone receptacle recently discovered under
the crypt and hevidently used for baptismal purposes.</p>

<p><i>A Spectacled S.</i> (<i>who feels it due to herself to put an intelligent
question at intervals</i>). What <i>was</i> the method of baptism among the
Early Christians?</p>

<p><i>The Verger.</i> We believe it to 'ave been by total immersion,
Ma'am.</p>

<p><i>The Spect. S.</i> Oh? <i>Baptists!</i></p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>She sets down the Early Christians as Dissenters, and takes
no further interest in them.</i></p>

<p><i>The Verger.</i> At the back of the choir, and immediately in front
of you, is the shrine, formerly containing the bones of St. Chasuble,
with relics of St. Alb. (<i>An</i> Evangelical Sightseer <i>snorts in
disapproval</i>.)
The 'ollow depressions in the steps leading up to the shrine,
which are still visible, were worn away, as you see, by the pilgrims
ascending on their knees. (<i>The party verify the depressions conscientiously,
and click their tongues to express indulgent contempt.</i>)
The spaces between the harches of the shrine were originally enriched
by valuable gems and mosaics, all of which 'ave now long
since disappeared, 'aving been removed by the more devout parties
who came 'ere on pilgrimages. In the chapel to your left a monument
with recumbent heffigies of Bishop <i>Buttress</i> and Dean
<i>Gurgoyle</i>, represented laying side by side with clasped 'ands, in
token of the lifelong affection between them. The late Bishop used
to make a rather facetious remark about this tomb. He was in the
'abit of observing that it was the honly instance in <i>his</i> experience of
a Bishop being on friendly terms with his Dean. (<i>He glances round
for appreciation of this instance of episcopal humour, but is pained
to find that it has produced a general gloom; the</i> Evangelical Sightseer,
<i>indeed, conveys by another, and a louder snort, his sense that
a Bishop ought to set a better example</i>.) In the harched recess to
your right, a monument in painted halibarster to Sir <span class="sc">Ralph Ringdove</span>
and his lady, erected
immediately after her decease
by the disconsolate widower,
with a touching inscription in
Latin, stating that their ashes
would shortly be commingled
in the tomb. (<i>He pauses, to
allow the ladies of the party
to express a becoming sympathy&mdash;which
they do, by
clicks.</i>) Sir <span class="sc">Ralph</span> himself,
however, is interred in Ficklebury
Parish Church, forty mile

I'm sure dog-tooth is quite <i>Early English</i>,

<p><i>The Verger.</i> That concludes my dooties,
ladies and gentlemen. You can go out by the
South Transep door, and that'll take you
through the Cloisters. (<i>The Party go out,

<h2>MEETING A VERY OLD FRIEND.</h2>

<p>(<i>A Postscript to a Well-known Work.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Alice</span> was delighted with all she saw.
Statesmen, generals, celebrities of every kind.
Then there were marvellous animals&mdash;some
ferocious, others satirical, every one of them
as true to nature as could be.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" asked <span class="sc">Alice</span>.</p>

<p>"In the gallery of the Fine Arts Society,
148, New Bond Street."</p>

<p>"And, please, who has done all these wonderful
things?"</p>

<p>"The great J. T.," was the reply.</p>

<p>And then she fell to admiring them. She
had some difficulty in getting to the drawings,
for every picture was surrounded by a
little crowd of worshippers. And she was not
in the least surprised, because the devotion
had been justly earned. Before her she found
a specimen of the labours of nearly half a
century. Everything good and beautiful.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she murmured, as she approached
No. 160 in the Catalogue. "Why
here I am myself! I am so glad I am like
that. What should I have been had I not
had so kind an artist to sketch me?"</p>

<p>And the possibility opened out such a vista
of disasters that <span class="sc">Alice</span> was almost moved to
tears. But she soon regained her gaiety when
she had glanced at "<i>Winding 'em up</i>"
(No. 161), "<i>A Bicycle built for Two</i>" (No. 148),
and "<i>The Mask of Momus</i>" (No. 99).</p>

<p>"But shall I meet the Knights?" she
asked, after a while. "I should, because I
certainly am living in Wonderland."</p>

<p>Then there was a chorus crying, "This is
the work of the Black and White Knight, the
greatest of all the Knights&mdash;good Sir <span class="sc">John</span>."</p>

<p>And <span class="sc">Alice</span> agreed in an opinion held by all
the world.</p>

<h2>"QUOUSQUE TANDEM?" OR, ONE AT A TIME.</h2>

<p><i>Duologue in a Dog-cart.</i></p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> Tc-c-c-h-k! Tc-c-c-h-k!!</p>

<p><i>Officious Friend.</i> Steady there! Wo-o-o-a!!</p>

<p><i>Driver</i> (<i>aside</i>). Confound the fellow! I wish he wouldn't
fidget so.</p>

<p><i>Officious Friend</i> (<i>aside</i>). <i>He</i> drive tandem? Wish he'd hand
the
ribbons to <i>me!</i></p>

<p><i>Driver</i> (<i>aloud</i>). Leader steps along, doesn't he?</p>

<p><i>Officious Friend</i> (<i>aloud</i>). Ya-a-s. Bit <i>too</i> fast, I fancy.
Forgets
that the wheeler has to do the work.</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> Humph! Not so sure of that, in this case. Rather
weedy, you know, and just a bit of a slug, if you ask me. <i>I</i> think
they'd do better reversed&mdash;this journey, anyhow.</p>

<p><i>Officious Friend</i> (<i>testily</i>). Nonsense! You never <i>have</i> done
that
wheeler justice. Fact is you don't understand the horse's character,
or how to get the best out of him. Now I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Driver</i> (<i>adapting old Trin. Coll., Cam., Recitation</i>).</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Fact is, he understood computing</p>

<p><i>Officious Friend.</i> What <i>are</i> you muttering about? You know

whip, anyhow, and though I don't agree with "Z" in his impertinent
comparisons, still&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> Still? Well, I wish you'd <i>sit</i> still, old fellow, and not
fidget with the reins. You're fretting that leader awfully.</p>

<p><i>Officious Friend.</i> Confound the leader! Leaders, equine
or&mdash;otherwise&mdash;(<i>sotto
voce</i>: I was <i>going</i> to say asinine!)&mdash;are so apt to give
themselves airs, and fancy they're pulling all the weight. Old G., for
example!</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> Ah! and he's not the <i>only</i> instance.</p>

<p class="rindent1">[<i>Sighs.</i></p>

<p><i>Officious Friend.</i> If G. had taken my tip, he'd never have upset
the coach as he did. But handlers of the ribbons are always so
obstinate. Look out! Mind that finger-post! Why, the leader
nearly ran into it.</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> Not at all, dear boy. But we'll run into <i>something</i>, and
be both spilt if you don't leave off twitching at the reins.</p>

<p><i>Officious Friend</i> (<i>reading finger-post</i>). Leamington! Hythe!
Aha! Now I think&mdash;as I know these roads well&mdash;if you'd just let
<i>me</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Driver</i> (<i>decisively</i>). Look here, old man! You remember our
Compact?</p>

<p><i>Officious Friend</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). Oh, of course, of course. But&mdash;I
don't quite understand it as you seem to do.</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> Humph! (<i>Again adapting.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Your Rule of the Road seems a paradox, quite;</p>
<p class="i2">For, in tooling our dog-cart along,</p>

<p class="i2">If the reins are <i>my</i> right, it's all wrong."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p><i>Officious Friend.</i> Oh, more poetry! What a chap you are for
Metaphysics and the Muses! Now the foundations of <i>my</i> belief are
facts and figures.</p>

<p><i>Driver</i> (<i>meditatively</i>). It's a fact that the Tory total figures
out much larger than the Liberal Unionist.</p>

<p><i>Officious Friend.</i> Oh, bother! What's that got to do with it!
Our Compact&mdash;&mdash;</p>

going? Look at that dashed leader!</p>

<p class="rindent1">[<i>Leader faces sharp round and fidgets.</i></p>

<p><i>Driver</i> (<i>sharply</i>). No wonder! Woa, lad, woa! Why on earth
did you tug at the reins like that. I tell you that horse won't stand
much more of it. Do you want a spill as well as a split?</p>

<p><i>Officious Friend.</i> Why, no! But according to our Compact, the
wheeler&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Driver.</i> According to our Compact it's <i>my</i> turn at the ribbons

<h2 class="sans">OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Marco Polo Ulysses Henry Norman</span>,
having returned from a comprehensive tour
in foreign parts, has set forth his experience
in a handsome volume published by <span class="sc">Fisher
Unwin</span>. <i>The Far Fast</i> is its alluring and
well-sustained title. But why drag in <span class="sc">Ulysses</span>
and <span class="sc">Marco Polo</span>? Their journeyings were on
the scale of a jaunt to Switzerland as compared
with Mr. <span class="sc">Norman's</span>. He has travelled through
British, French, Spanish and Portuguese
Colonies; has visited Siberia, China, Japan,
Corea, Siam and Malaya. Whether in his
study of political problems, his pictures of
people, or his sketches of scenery, he is equally
keen and habile. Anything that relates to
China is peculiarly interesting just now, and
Mr. <span class="sc">Norman</span> throws a flood of light on the
state of the unwieldly empire. The description
of the examination halls is instructive.
The Government of China, Mr. <span class="sc">Norman</span> testifies,
is a vast system of competitive examination
tempered by bribery. Those who come
out successfully in examinations&mdash;the subject-matter
of which is knowledge of the works of
<span class="sc">Confucius</span>, the history of China, and the art
of writing as practised by the old masters&mdash;have
berths found them under the Government.
They are sent all over the country to be magistrates,
generals, ship captains, engineers,
without having the slightest acquaintance
with details or systems over which they are
put in a position of command. This fully
accounts for what has taken place in recent
campaigns by land and sea in the Far East.
We can't all undertake Mr. <span class="sc">Norman's</span> monumental
journey. But, adapting <span class="sc">Sheridan's</span>
advice to his son on a certain occasion, my
Baronite counsels the public to read <i>The Far
East</i> and say they've been there.</p>

<p>The immortal <span class="sc">Flaccus</span> (writes one of the
Baron's assistants) has, it appears, been
sojourning in Cambridge, having gone into
residence there some time before he stayed at
Hawarden, either for translation or perversion.
I make this statement after reading a
delightful little book of light verse entitled
<i>Horace at Cambridge</i>, by <span class="sc">Owen Seaman</span>
(London, <span class="sc">A. D. Innes &amp; Co.</span>). To every
University man, and particularly, of course,
to Cambridge men, this book will be a rare
treat. But in virtue of its humour, its extreme
and felicitous dexterity of workmanship
both in rhyme and metre, and the aptness
of its allusions, it will appeal to a far
wider public. I pledge Mr. <span class="sc">Seaman</span> in a
bumper of College Audit! and beg him to
give us more of his work.</p>

<h3>"SUR LE TAPIS" DE BRUXELLES.</h3>

<p class="ind">However clever as a dramatic author he,
<span class="sc">M. Maurice Maeterlinck</span> of Brussels, may
be, it is rather handicapping him to be dubbed

course, "Belgian" does qualify the <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>,
just as Brussels prefixed to sprout

the "coming on," or sprouting, dramatist of

has not been much in any way to connect

may be the missing link destined to electrically

<h3>PROPOSED RULES FOR THE LADIES' UNIVERSAL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p class="title1">(<i>Compiled by One thoroughly Conversant
with the Necessities of the
Situation.</i>)</p>

<p>1. The costume of every member
of the Club shall be of the most
elegant description. The design
shall not be governed by the requirements
of the game for which
the uniform is required, but rather
by the characteristics of the
wearer.</p>

<p>2. Red and blue shall be worn
according to the complexion of the
player, and the choice of teams
shall depend not upon prowess or
locality, but the colour of the hair
and eyes and the formation of the
noses.</p>

<p>3. Patent leather shoes shall invariably
form a part of the <i>grande
tenue</i> of the Club, with high heels
at discretion.</p>

<p>4. Football shall be played with
a light india-rubber globe, and
"pushing" shall be strictly forbidden.
However, it shall be
permissible for one player to hold
an opponent tightly by the hands
if the former thinks the latter is
about to give it "quite a hard
kick" with her toe.</p>

<p>5. No angry language will be
allowed, but one member may tell
another, in the height of an exciting
contest, that she is "a spiteful,
disagreeable old thing." On
very special occasions the word
"There!" may be added with
emphasis.</p>

<p>6. Cricket shall never be allowed
to last for more than half an hour,
and cups of tea shall be served to
the strikers between the overs.</p>

<p>7. Only ladies shall be permitted
to watch the game of the members,
as a rule. However, at times when
everyone is looking her best, individuals
of the inferior sex shall be
admitted to the football ground or
cricket field, on the condition that
they "promise not to laugh."</p>

<p>8. Players at football, cricket,
and other games sanctioned by
the Association, shall have full
liberty to make their own rules
and keep their own appointments.
They will be usually expected to
wait until a match is finished,
unless called away to take a drive
in the Park, or do a little shopping.</p>

<p>9 and Lastly. As women are as
excellent as men at field sports,
the members of the Club shall be
entitled to the franchise.</p>

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>All hail to Sir <span class="sc">Henry</span>, whom nothing surprises;</p>
<p class="i2">Ye Judges and suitors, regard him with awe,</p>
<p>As he sits up aloft on the Bench and applies his</p>
<p class="i2">Swift mind to the shifts and the tricks of the Law.</p>
<p>Many years has he lived, and has always seen clear things</p>
<p class="i2">That Nox seemed to hide from our average eyes:</p>
<p>But still, though encompassed with all sorts of queer things,</p>
<p class="i2">He never, no never gives way to surprise.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>When a rogue, for example, a company-monger,</p>
<p class="i2">Grows fat on the gain of the shares he has sold,</p>
<p>While the public gets lean, winning nothing but hunger</p>
<p class="i2">And a few scraps of scrip for its masses of gold;</p>
<p>When the fat man goes further and takes to religion,</p>
<p class="i2">A rascal in hymn-books and bibles disguised,</p>
<p>"It's a case," says Sir <span class="sc">Henry</span>, "of rook <i>versus</i> pigeon,</p>
<p class="i2">And the pigeon gets left&mdash;well, I'm hardly surprised."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>There's a Heath at Newmarket, and horses that run there,</p>
<p class="i2">There are owners and jockeys, and sharpers and flats;</p>
<p>There are some who do nicely, and some who are done there,</p>
<p class="i2">There are loud men with pencils and satchels and hats.</p>
<p>But the Stewards see nothing of betting or money,</p>
<p class="i2">As they stand in the blinkers for Stewards devised;</p>
<p>Their blindness may strike <span class="sc">Henry Hawkins</span> as funny,</p>
<p class="i2">But he only smiles softly, he isn't surprised.</p>

<p>So, here's to Sir <span class="sc">Henry</span>, the terror of tricksters,</p>
<p class="i2">Of Law he's a master, and likewise a limb:</p>
<p>His mind never once, when its purpose is fixed, errs;</p>
<p class="i2">For cuteness there's none holds a candle to him.</p>
<p>Let them try to deceive him, why, bless you, he's <i>been</i> there,</p>
<p class="i2">And can track his way straight through a tangle of lies;</p>
<p>And, though some might grow grey at the things he has seen there,</p>
<p class="i2">He never, no never, gives way to surprise.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title1">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Lords, Monday, March 25.</i>&mdash;Impossible to avoid noticing
depression of the <span class="sc">Markiss</span> when he entered House to-night. At
first thought feelings of a father had overcome him. <span class="sc">Cranborne</span>,
immediately after eloquent and energetic attack in other House of
Welsh Disestablishment Bill, was struck down by indisposition,
reported to be measles. That all very well. Do not wish to suggest
anything wrong; but coincidence at least remarkable. Measles, the
Member for <span class="sc">Sark</span> tells me, can be conveyed in various apparently
innoxious guises. In a controversy so acrid that <span class="sc">George Osborne
Morgan</span> has been publicly accused of profligacy, men will, it is too
obvious, go any lengths. At present there is nothing that can be
called evidence to connect <span class="sc">Cranborne's</span> sudden indisposition with
current controversy. But if this mysterious attack is followed by
symptoms of croup, rickets, teething, or any other complaint usually
associated with happy days in the nursery, the public will know what
to think.</p>

<p>Happily it turned out that the depression of the <span class="sc">Markiss</span> had
nothing to do with the condition of the heir of Hatfield. His sympathetic
heart been touched by difficulties that environ a worthy class
of men whom <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span>, conscious that <span class="sc">Cobb's</span> eye is upon
him, has recently been making magistrates. "Excellent persons,"
says the <span class="sc">Markiss</span>; "self-made men. But unfortunately the process
of self-manufacture does not include knowledge of the statutes at
large." There is the Parish Councils Act, for example; one of those
pieces of legislation with which a reckless Radical majority has
embarrassed an ancient State. This law has to be administered by
people unlearned in Acts of Parliament. They cannot take a step
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg 168]</span>
without having sixteen volumes of the statutes at large tucked under
their arms. What the benevolent and thoughtful <span class="sc">Markiss</span> suggested
was, that in all future legislation there shall be reprinted
sections of Acts of Parliament referred to in text of Bill.</p>

<p>House listened with admiration to statesman who, his mind
engrossed by imperial cares, could find time to think out schemes for
easing the pathway of working-men magistrates, and assisting
operation of Parish Councils Act. Only, somehow, there was left on
minds of hearers a strong impression
that working-men magistrates are a
mistake, and the Parish Councils Act
a public injury, of which the Government
ought to be more than ordinarily
ashamed.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;More speech-making
round Welsh Disestablishment
Bill in Commons. Direfully dull.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;"Speakers
may come, and Speakers
may go," said the Member for <span class="sc">Sark</span>,
"but as long as the House of Commons
produces men like <span class="sc">Vicary Gibbs</span> the
institution is safe, and the State rocks
safely on its everlasting foundations.
It was, you will remember, <span class="sc">Vicary</span>
who directly, though undesignedly,
led to the row on that famous night in
June when Home-Rule Committee was
closured. <span class="sc">Vicary</span> shares with Heaven
the peculiarity that order is his first
law. On that particular night somebody
had said something, and <span class="sc">Vicary</span>
wanted to have his words taken down.
Amid growing uproar his observations
were inaudible to the Chair, and his
presence undistinguishable. Some men
would thereupon have resumed their
seat. <span class="sc">Vicary</span>, his soul athirst to have
something 'taken down,' moved on
to the Front Opposition Bench, and
shouted his desire in <span class="sc">Mellor's</span> left
ear. Then <span class="sc">Logan</span> suddenly loomed
large on the scene. <span class="sc">Hayes Fisher</span>
reached forth a red right hand and shook him by the collar. Next an
anonymous Irish Member fell over the bench on to <span class="sc">Saunderson's</span> knee,
and was there incontinently but heartily pummelled. After that
chaos; all arising out of <span class="sc">Vicary Gibbs's</span> insatiable, uncontrollable
desire to have something 'taken down' in the sacred name of order."</p>

<p>These musings on the mighty past were occasioned by <span class="sc">Vicary</span> once
more unexpectedly, but sternly and effectively, interposing as the
custodian of order. <span class="sc">Weir</span> broken out in epidemic of questions; puts
down eleven on the paper; runs them up to the full score by supplementary
questions, invariably prefaced by the formula "Is the right
hon. gentleman <span class="sc">A. Weir</span> that&mdash;&mdash;?" A poor joke, its only flash
of humour being in the subtly varied tone with which the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>
eleven times pronounced the words, "Mr. <span class="sc">Weir</span>." Also grotesquely
funny to hear the reverberation of the deep chest notes, in which
<span class="sc">Weir</span>, with tragic sweep of <i>pince-nez</i> on to his nose, said in
succession,
"Ques-ti-on one," "Ques-ti-on two," and so on.</p>

<p>Touch of tragedy came in when <span class="sc">Vicary</span>, managing to throw into
tone and form of question conviction that <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> was
secretly at bottom of the whole business, asked him whether this was
not abuse of forms of the House, calculated to lead to curtailment of
valuable privilege. No use <span class="sc">Squire</span> assuming air of innocence.
House knew all about it. Refreshed and revived by <span class="sc">Vicary's</span> timely
vindication of law and order, proceeded to business.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Fourth night's Debate on Welsh Church Disestablishment
Bill. The still prevalent dulness varied by speech from
<span class="sc">Plunket</span>; witched the House by music of stately though simple
eloquence.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Desperate dulness of week further relieved by discovery
of new game. <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>, <i>Inv.</i> House just got into
Committee of Supply; Vote on Account under discussion; this covers
multitudinous items; every spending department of State concerned.
When Committee of Supply deals with Army Estimates, <span class="sc">Cawmell-Bannerman</span>
and the <span class="sc">Winsome Woodall</span> in their places. The rest
of Ministers may go away, knowing that everything is well. The
same when Navy Estimates are on, or when particular votes in the
Civil Service Estimates are to the fore. Ministers of particular
departments affected in their place; the rest at liberty.</p>

<p>To-night, as no one knew who might be called on next, all agreed
to stop away&mdash;all but the faithful <span class="sc">Hibbert</span>. Cap'en <span class="sc">Tommy</span>, as
usual, aloft in the Crow's Nest, perceived this weak point. Hauling
on the bowline, and making all taut, he bore down swiftly on the
Treasury Bench, and hailed it for the President of the Board of
Trade. Wanted to talk to <span class="sc">Bryce</span>, he said, about lighthouses. No
one knew better than <span class="sc">Tommy</span> that <span class="sc">Bryce</span> wasn't aboard. According
to regulations, he ought to have been. Search made for him.
Presently brought in with hands in pockets, trying to whistle, and
otherwise present appearance of indifference. But a poor show.</p>

<p class="center">Sir John Leng strongly objects to Lion-taming Exhibitions.</p></div>

<p>Encouraged by this success, Private <span class="sc">Hanbury</span>, observing
<span class="sc">Robertson</span>
was among absentees, addressed question to Civil Lord of
Admiralty about Peterhead Harbour. <span class="sc">Hibbert's</span> agony of mind at
this juncture would have softened harder hearts. An elderly hen,
that has counted its brood seven times,
on each occasion finding one or two
missing, not more perturbed. Looked
up and down Treasury Bench. <span class="sc">Robertson</span>,
not within sight; might be
below the Gangway. Vain hope. For
Members opposite interest in Peterhead
Harbour growing keener and
more urgent. <span class="sc">Francis Powell</span>,
usually mild-mannered man, went so
far as to move to report progress.
<span class="sc">Mellor</span> declined to put question.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Blameless
<span class="sc">Bartley</span>, with air of martyr. "We
must go on talking about Peterhead
Harbour till the Minister comes in."</p>

<p>So he did, and when he ran dry
<span class="sc">Tomlinson</span> (having meanwhile ascertained
where Peterhead Harbour is)
took up the wondrous tale. Talking
when <span class="sc">Hibbert</span> reappeared, his breast
now swelling with maternal pride and
satisfaction. He had found the lost
chick, and clucked low notes of supreme
content as he brought him back to the
roost. Pretty to see how, Civil Lord
in his place, all interest in Peterhead
Harbour subsided, Busy B's turning
their attention to alleged felonious
underrating of Government property.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Vote on Account
through Committee. Sir <span class="sc">John Leng</span>
calls <span class="sc">Asquith's</span> attention to dangerous
occupation of lion-tamers. "All very
well," he says, "for doughty knight
like me. But these poor fellows with families shouldn't be allowed
to run risks."</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;"What's the business at to-night's sitting?"
asked <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>, looking over Orders of the Day.
"Home Rule all round? Very well. Shall give practical proof of
adherence to principle by stopping at home."</p>

<p><span class="sc">John Morley</span> did same, most other Ministers following suit.
<span class="sc">Cawmel-Bannerman</span> sacrificed himself on altar of country. But
insisted that he might at least dine out in interval between morning
and evening sitting that made last day of Parliamentary week. His
snowy shirt front gave air of almost reckless joviality to desolate
Treasury Bench. <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, not to be outdone in chivalry,
also looked in after dinner, brightening up Front Bench opposite
Minister for War. But two swallows don't make a summer, nor two
gentlemen in evening dress a festive party. <span class="sc">Trevelyan</span> only man
in earnest, and he terribly so.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Home Rule all round decreed by majority of 26
in House of 230.</p>
